Fortis is a library that forms the basis of a strongly typed model of the Sitecore API. This enables us to develop reliable, maintainable sites more efficiently than with traditional, losely typed Sitecore development.

Key Benefits:
* Encapsulating the Sitecore API and seperates out business logic, allowing for easier unit testing.
* Elimiates "magic strings"
* Build errors instead of run time errors
* Easily add custom functionality around the Sitecore Item class
* Simplfy regularly used Sitecore API calls
* It encapsulates the Sitecore API - so all the code is running standard Sitecore API calls, this means that all page editor functionality will still work.
